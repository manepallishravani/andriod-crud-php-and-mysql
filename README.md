# andriod-crud-php-and-mysql

Sample project for learn how to connecting android app with mysql on localhost with another db action like CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE data in MySQL database. To brief you on the architecture, this is how it works. First your android app calls a PHP script in order to perform a data operation, lets say “create”. The PHP script then connects to your MySQL database to perform the operation.
So the data flows from your Android app to PHP script then finally is stored in your MySQL database.
